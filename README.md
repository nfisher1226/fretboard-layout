# Fretboard Layout
==================
## Introduction
This library takes a set of specifications for a musical instrument fretboard
and generates an SVG image suitable for use as a template in the design of an
instrument. Currently, measurements are expected to be in millimeters.
## Building
You will need a Rust toolchain installed, including cargo. To build the program,
run ```cargo build --release``` to build a release library in target/release.
